# Music App UI for Apple Watch - SwiftUI

## [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/nY9e_yGlWaU)


We create three screens for the music app that runs on your apple watch for that we use SwiftUI. On the home screen, it shows a banner at the top then a grid view of popular artists. Then there is a artist screen where you can find your favorite artist. At the end, we create a songs screen with work for both means for any atrist or album.
